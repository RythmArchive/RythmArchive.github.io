title: Rythm bots
---
All Rythm bots that we're publicly aware of.

**This is an unofficial list; it is a personal project of mine and is not affiliated with Rythm;** however, I used to be a trial moderator for the Rythm Community (now Discord.fm) Discord server, and am aware that this list may be lacking information. Such lacking information I would only be able to discover because of my position as a staff member, and as such I will not put it on this list. Keywords in that first sentence at the top of this page: publicly.

|Unknown|*Sent by someone who will remain anonymous; thank you for your contribution!* This bot tracked shards for the [Rythm HQ](https://discord.gg/rythm) server to post in #shards. This person thankfully saved the logo, but sadly(?) we cannot confirm the original filename. The file has a filename of `rythm-info`, so the best assumption we can make is that it was most likely just called "Rythm Info".|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown|No|Defunct
